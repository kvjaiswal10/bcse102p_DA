GRAPHICS.H

In C++, graphics.h is a header file that was commonly used in older versions of the Borland Turbo C/C++ compiler. It provided a simple graphics library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and drawing basic shapes on the screen.

The graphics.h header file contained various functions and constants for handling graphics operations. Some of the functions provided by graphics.h included initgraph() to initialize the graphics system, closegraph() to close the graphics system, line() to draw a line, circle() to draw a circle, rectangle() to draw a rectangle, and so on.

It can be installed for the IDE Dev C++ from GitHub. 

LOGIC AND METHODS USED 

The object is drawn out using the methods available from the header file with the addition of a for loop so that after each index, the object seems to be moving. It can be made into an infinite movement or restricted as well. 

The rectangle() method is used to draw a rectangle; 
line() for a straight line;
circle() for a circle with center x, y and radius r;
These are the basic methods used for drawing shapes.
The method setcolor(COLOR_NAME) is used to set boundary color.
The method initgraph() is used to initialize the graphics system.
