DEV C++

Dev-C++ is a free integrated development program for Windows that helps reduce the manual work required when programming.  Dev-C++ comes with a wide range of features such as an integrated debugger, class browser, automatic code completion, function listing, profiling support, customizable code editor, project manager, and pre-made templates for various projects, tools manager, and more.
Millions of developers, students and researchers use Dev-C++ since the first version was released in 1998. It has been featured in dozens of C++ and scientific books and remains one of the favorite learning tool among universities & schools worldwide
The software is free (under a GNU General Public Licence) for distribution and modifiable.
Because Dev-C++ is a native Windows app and only uses a small amount of memory, it won't cause your computer to slow down. It uses the MinGW compiler to create C and C++ applications and could work in conjunction with other compilers that are GCC-based, such as Cygwin.
Dev-C++ lets you create, edit, and execute programs in C languages. It also comes with useful features that help increase your efficiency when coding.  


GRAPHICS.H

Graphics programming in C used to drawing various geometrical shapes(rectangle, circle eclipse etc), use of mathematical function in drawing curves, coloring an object with different colors and patterns and simple animation programs like jumping ball and moving cars.In c++ to inculcate the above mentioned shapes and objects, the header file graphics.h must be used . This header file was commonly used in the older versions of Borland Turbo C and C++ compiler. It provided a simple graphics library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and drawing basic shapes on the screen.
The graphics.h header file contained various functions and constants for handling graphics operations. Some of the functions provided by graphics.h included initgraph() to initialize the graphics system, closegraph() to close the graphics system, line() to draw a line, circle() to draw a circle, rectangle() to draw a rectangle, and so on.

It can be installed for the IDE Dev C++ from GitHub.

LOGIC AND METHODS USED 

The object is drawn out using the methods available from the header file with the addition of a for loop so that after each index, the object seems to be moving. It can be made into an infinite movement or restricted as well. 

The rectangle() method is used to draw a rectangle; 
line() for a straight line;
circle() for a circle with center x, y and radius r;
These are the basic methods used for drawing shapes.
The method setcolor(COLOR_NAME) is used to set boundary color.
The method initgraph() is used to initialize the graphics system.
